# Book-Shop
•	Developed a C++ program to create an efficient inventory management system for a bookshop.
•	Designed and implemented a class called Books with appropriate member functions and constructors to store and manage book details, such as author, title, price, publisher, and stock position.
•	Utilized the new operator in constructors to dynamically allocate memory space required for the book data.
